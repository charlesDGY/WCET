# conference, workshop & symposium

## Real-Time System Symposium （RTSS)
IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the area of real-time systems, presenting innovations in the field with respect to theory and practice. RTSS provides a forum for the presentation of high-quality, original research covering all aspects of real-time systems design, analysis, implementation, evaluation, and experiences. RTSS 2013 continues the trend of making RTSS an expansive and inclusive symposium, looking to embrace new and emerging areas of real-time systems research.

**Workshop:**
### CRTS：Compositional Theory and Technology for Real-Time Embedded Systems

* **[CRTS 2013](http://www.mrtc.mdh.se/CRTS2013/)**

## IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium（RTAS）

* **[RTAS 2013](http://www.cister.isep.ipp.pt/rtas2013/)**



## IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications（RTCSA）

* **[RTCSA 2013](http://140.116.247.217/)**



## EUROMICRO Conference on Real-Time Systems（ECRTS）
The technical committee on real-time systems promotes state-of-the-art research and research for applications wtih temporal constraints, real-time systems. Such computing systems have to provide results which are not only correct, but also delivered in time. Instead of average behavior as for standard computing, real-time systems have to allow for guarantees that the temporal requirements will be met.

**Satellite Workshops:**

### WCET：Worst Case Execution Time Analysis



### RTSOPS：Real-Time Scheduling Open Problems Seminar

**Website: **http://rtsops.org/


### OSPERT：Operating Systems Platforms for Embedded Real-Time Applications



### WATERS：Analysis Tools and Methodologies for Embedded and Real-Time Systems
The ambitious goal of the International Workshop on Anaysis Tools and Methodologies for Embedded and Real-time Systems is to start creating a common ground and a community to collect methodologies, software tools, best practices, data sets, application models, benchmarks and any other way to improve comparability of results in the current practice of research in real-time and embedded systems. People from industry are welcome to contribute as well with realistic data or methods coming from their own experience, which in the midterm may serve as benchmarks for assessing real-time research efforts.
